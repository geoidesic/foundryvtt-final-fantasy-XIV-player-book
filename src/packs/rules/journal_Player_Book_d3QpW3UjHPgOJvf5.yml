        <h1>Introduction</h1><p>The Final Fantasy XIV Tabletop Roleplaying Game
        is a gateway into the magical world of Final Fantasy XIV through which
        you and your friends can embark on exciting and memorable adventures.
        Whereas Final Fantasy XIV Online tells the tale of the Warrior of Light,
        this game allows you to assume the role of one of Hydaelyn’s many unsung
        adventurers and experience the star’s myriad wonders for
        yourself.</p><p>When you play the Final Fantasy XIV TTRPG, one player
        will act as your gamemaster—the game’s arbiter and lead storyteller. The
        rest of your group will play as adventurers, and together, you will
        weave your very own tales of adventure. Keep in mind that this game is
        not about winning or losing. If you have a good time collaborating with
        your friends to create an exciting story, everyone wins.</p><h1>Commonly
        Used Terms</h1><h2>Gamemaster (GM)</h2><p>The player who accepts the
        mantle of Gamemaster—or GM— will be your guide to the myriad adventures
        that await you in the Final Fantasy XIV TTRPG.</p><p>The GM describes
        the world the player characters inhabit and any situations they
        encounter. They also assume control of any non-player characters or
        monsters the adventurers come across.</p><h2>Players</h2><p>Aside from
        the GM, each player will play as an adventurer—their very own character
        within the game world. In most games, a given player will control a
        single adventurer.</p><h2>Scenarios</h2><p>Scenarios are collections of
        story beats and encounters prepared in advance by the GM. These will
        make up the bulk of the setting for your adventures.</p><p>While you are
        more than welcome to use the oﬃcial scenarios that are available for
        purchase, you can—and are encouraged to—craft your own adventures as
        well. Building your own story can be a lot of fun!</p><h2>Adventurers
        (Player Characters)</h2><p>Intrepid inhabitants of Hydaelyn, adventurers
        seek out challenges to surmount and mysteries to unravel. The
        adventurers controlled by the players are also known as player
        characters.</p><p>You can choose to play as a premade adventurer, or
        create your own adventurer by following the steps outlined in the
        Standard Rulebook.</p><p></p><h2>NPCs (Non-Player Characters)</h2><p>The
        diverse beings who live on Hydaelyn but aren’t player characters are
        called NPCs. NPCs are almost always controlled by the
        GM.</p><h2>Monsters</h2><p>Hostile NPCs are frequently referred to as
        monsters in the game’s rules and scenarios. This is a general term that
        can encompass humanoid and otherworldly foes in addition to beasts of
        fang and claw.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>All beings who reside on
        Hydaelyn and can be affected by the various forces and eﬀects outlined
        in the game’s rules are collectively referred to as characters. This
        includes adventurers, NPCs, and monsters.</p><p>Eﬀects that can be
        applied to a character will impact adventurers, NPCs, and monsters in
        the same way.</p><h2>Allies</h2><p>Characters who are aligned in cause
        or purpose with the adventurers are considered to be
        allies.</p><p>Adventurers are allied with the other members of their
        party, as well as with any NPCs helping them. Monsters are allied with
        other monsters that are attacking the adventurers, as well as with any
        NPCs controlling them through means magical or mundane. Ultimately, the
        GM has the final say as to whether two characters are
        allies.</p><h2>Enemies</h2><p>Characters who oppose each other or are
        otherwise hostile are considered to be enemies. Adventurers consider the
        monsters that attack them and the NPCs that harbor malicious intent
        towards the people of Hydaelyn to be enemies. Monsters, on the other
        hand, generally view the adventurers and any NPCs belonging to a Grand
        Company as enemies.</p><p>Ultimately, the GM has the final say as to
        whether two characters are enemies.</p><h2>Dice</h2><p>Dice rolls are
        used to determine whether certain actions succeed or fail. Dice come in
        a variety of shapes and sizes. In the game’s rules and scenarios, dice
        are referred to by using the letter d followed by the number of sides.
        For example, d20 refers to a twenty-sided die.</p><p>Sometimes, you’ll
        need to roll multiple dice at once. This is indicated by a number before
        the letter d. For example, if you see 3d6, you need to roll three
        six-sided dice.</p><p>Dice rolls can have modifiers, which are indicated
        by a plus or minus after the dice to be rolled. 2d6 + 4 means you roll
        two six-sided dice, add them together, then add 4 to the
        total.</p><p>These modifiers can also refer to a character’s
        attributes.</p><p>d20 + STR means you roll a twenty-sided die and add
        your character’s STR.</p><p></p><h1>Playing the Game</h1><p>Player
        groups will generally play through scenarios by following this basic
        pattern:</p><p>1. The GM describes the situation in which the
        adventurers find themselves.</p><p>2. The players tell the GM what
        actions their adventurers take.</p><p>3. The GM describes what effect
        the adventurers’ actions have had on the situation. If an adventurer
        attempts to perform a challenging action, the GM will ask that player to
        make a check to see if their efforts succeed.</p><p>4. Return to step 1
        and repeat to continue the adventure.</p><p>Players should have their
        adventurer sheets on hand at all times during the game. Meanwhile, the
        GM will frequently need to refer to the scenario to review information
        for NPCs and items that show up during an adventure.</p><h1>The Golden
        Rule</h1><p>This game was designed to provide a framework that allows
        you to embark on exciting and memorable adventures in the magical world
        of Final Fantasy XIV. The ultimate goal is to have fun with your
        friends, and for this to work, all participants need to be considerate
        and respectful of one another while playing.</p><p>The GM is the
        architect of your adventure, curating the events that occur as you
        progress through the scenario. At times, they may decide to handle
        things in a way that diﬀers from these rules or from other tabletop
        games you’ve played. When this happens, always remember that their main
        goal is to facilitate an exciting journey for your
        adventurers.</p><p>Their decision might stem from a special rule that
        applies to a monster in the scenario, or could simply be that they’re
        bending the rules in order to enhance the story for everyone involved.
        Players are not privy to the rationale behind such decisions, and in the
        end, the GM has the final say in all game-related matters.</p><p>Of
        course, the GM’s discretionary powers are limited to the game alone. GMs
        cannot make decisions about matters outside of the game without the
        consent of their players, nor do they have the right to force players to
        do anything they aren’t comfortable with.</p><p>Keep in mind that while
        the GM may control monsters and other foes, you aren’t playing against
        them. The people at your gaming table are friends with whom you’re
        collaborating to create a story.</p><p>GMs are not infallible. As the
        GM, if you are ever uncertain as to how to proceed, don’t hesitate to
        consult with the other players. Together, you’ll find a way to continue
        the game that will be fun for everyone involved.</p><p>Players are
        encouraged to work with their GM and are free to oﬀer suggestions that
        could make the game more enjoyable. So long as these ideas fit the
        scenario and don’t derail the story, the GM should make an eﬀort to
        incorporate player feedback into their game.</p><p>Following this golden
        rule will help make your adventure more enjoyable. It’s okay to
        encourage other players to share this mindset, and to respectfully raise
        issues should something go awry. And above all else, remember the point
        of the game: to have fun!</p><h1>Making Checks</h1><p>When a character
        takes an action where the outcome is uncertain or is dependent on the
        skill with which the action is performed, the player controlling that
        character rolls a d20 to determine success or failure.</p><p>Follow
        these three steps when making a check:</p><p>1. Determine the type of
        check required and assign a challenge rating.</p><p>2. Roll a d20 and
        apply any relevant modifiers.</p><p>3. Determine the success or failure
        of the action.</p><h2>1. Determining Check Type and Assigning Challenge
        Ratings</h2><p>The GM determines the type of check required and assigns
        it a challenge rating (CR) appropriate to the action the character is
        attempting. For example, attempting to lift a toppled carriage would
        require a STR check, whereas trying to decipher an encoded journal would
        require an INT check.</p><p>Attributes such as STR and INT are explained
        on page 8. If a check is required to determine success or failure when a
        character performs an action or uses an ability outside of an encounter,
        the GM will first determine the appropriate value to use for that
        check—usually a primary attribute.</p><p>Then, they will assign a CR
        based on the scenario, the ability in question, or the Challenge Rating
        Reference Table.</p><p>Ability checks are used to determine how
        successful a char- acter is when using an ability in an encounter. When
        making an ability check, the ability being used indicates the value and
        CR for the check.</p><table><tbody><tr><td
        colspan="4"><p><strong>Challenge Rating Reference
        Table</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Easy</p></td><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>Very
        Hard</p></td><td><p>20</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Average</p></td><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>Extremely
        Hard</p></td><td><p>25</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hard</p></td><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>Nearly
        Impossible</p></td><td><p>30</p></td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p>The
        Challenge Rating Reference Table is intended merely as a point of
        reference, and may be adjusted to suit the check being made. For
        example, if an adventurer is attempting something slightly harder than
        average, you could assign it a CR of 11. If the task is hard but still
        within their capabilities, you could assign it a CR of
        18.</p></blockquote><h2>2. Rolling Dice and Applying Modifiers</h2><p>To
        make a check, roll a d20 and add the appropriate value.</p><p>Then add
        or subtract any modifiers conferred by traits, abilities, enhancements,
        or enfeeblements.</p><h3>3. Determining Success or Failure</h3><p>If the
        total from step 2 equals or exceeds the target CR, your character
        succeeds. If the total is lower than the target CR, their attempt ends
        in failure, or succeeds in an unexpected manner that results in an
        undesirable outcome. The GM will describe what happens as a result of
        the check according to the scenario or their own judgment.</p><h1>When
        (Not) to Make Checks</h1><p>Not all actions require a check—a hale
        adventurer will have little trouble rising from their bed, strapping on
        their arms and armor, and leaving their inn room. Such tasks come
        naturally, and are therefore guaranteed to succeed.</p><p>The same
        applies to actions where a character’s eﬀorts are guaranteed to fail. No
        matter how skilled they may be, an adventurer hurling a pebble into the
        mouth of a cave can’t expect their throw to kill a powerful monster deep
        within. The best they could hope for would be to scare oﬀ a few cave
        bats.</p><p>As a general rule, you only need to make checks if the
        outcome of an action is uncertai</p><h2>Example 1</h2><blockquote><p>A
        paladin is walking down the road towards the Silver Bazaar when they
        come across an overturned chocobo carriage. The coachman, upon noticing
        the adventurer’s approach, beseeches them to right the toppled
        vehicle.</p><p>As an attempt to lift the carriage is a somewhat physi-
        cally challenging endeavor that could end in failure, the GM calls for a
        STR check with a CR of 13 to see if the paladin’s muscles are up to the
        task.</p><p>The player rolls a d20, which lands on 11. Their
        adventurer’s STR is +4, meaning their total is 15.</p><p>This exceeds
        the check’s CR, so the paladin successfully lifts the
        carriage!</p><p><strong>GM:</strong> You take hold of the upended
        carriage and heave with all your might. Slowly, you raise it from the
        ground and set it back on the road.</p></blockquote><h2>Example
        2</h2><blockquote><p>While researching an ancient ruin, a black mage
        stumbles upon a journal written using a complex cipher. Curious, they
        try to decode it.</p><p>As an attempt to break this particularly diﬃcult
        cipher is a mentally challenging task that has a high chance of ending
        in failure, the GM calls for an INT check with a CR of 17.</p><p>The
        player rolls a d20, which lands on 9. Their adven- turer’s INT is +5,
        giving them a total of 14. As this falls short of the check’s CR, the
        black mage fails to make sense of the
        journal.</p><p><strong>GM:</strong> You run through every method you can
        think of to crack the code, but are unable to unravel the journal’s
        secrets.</p></blockquote><h1>Advantage Dice</h1><p>Some traits,
        abilities, enhancements, and situations will grant advantage dice.
        Advantage dice allow you to roll extra d20s when making certain
        checks.</p><p>For example, if you have two advantage dice when making a
        check, you would roll a total of three d20s for that check.</p><p>After
        rolling your d20s, choose one of the results to use for the check. Take
        care that you do not add the results together by mistake!</p><h2>Example
        1</h2><blockquote><p>A scholar has a trait that gives them one advantage
        die on checks related to studying tomes</p><p>and scrolls.</p><p>Hoping
        to discover information about a lost civilization in an ancient scroll,
        the player makes an INT check with a CR of 12. Because their trait gives
        them one advantage die, they roll two d20s, which land on 8 and 12. They
        choose to use the higher roll of 12, and add their adventurer’s INT (+3)
        for a total of 15—a success!</p><p><strong>GM:</strong> You swiftly pore
        over the scroll and locate the information you
        seek.</p></blockquote><h2>Example 2:</h2><blockquote><p>A ninja has an
        ability that gives them two advantage dice on ability
        checks.</p><p>During an encounter, this adventurer uses Throwing Dagger
        on a villager being controlled by an enemy NPC in an attempt to render
        them unconscious. This requires them to make an ability check using
        their DEX, with a CR determined by the target’s Defense. The player
        rolls three d20s, which land on 1, 17, and 20. Worried that using too
        high a result could deal too much damage and seriously harm the innocent
        villager, the player chooses to use the 1. They add their adventurer’s
        DEX (+5) for a total of 6.</p><p><strong>GM:</strong> The total is less
        than the villager’s Defense, so Throwing Dagger deals just enough damage
        to knock them out.</p></blockquote><h1>Penalties</h1><p>Some traits,
        abilities, enfeeblements, and situations will impose penalties when
        making certain checks.</p><p>Penalties are applied after you roll a d20
        and add or subtract all applicable modifiers. If multiple penalties
        apply to a single check, use the largest of them and ignore the
        others.</p><h2>Example:</h2><blockquote><p>A warrior is suﬀering from a
        -3 penalty to STR checks due to the eﬀect of an ability, and a -2
        penalty to all checks due to the Slow enfeeblement.</p><p>This
        adventurer attempts to hold up a collapsing wall, which requires a STR
        check with a CR of 15. The player rolls a d20, which lands on 16. They
        then add their adventurer’s STR (+4) for a total of 20. Because both
        penalties mentioned above aﬀect this roll, they apply the larger of the
        two (-3), reducing their total to 17.</p><p>Even with the penalty, the
        warrior succeeds and is able to keep the wall from crushing their
        allies!</p></blockquote><h1>Advantage Dice and Penalties</h1><p>At
        times, circumstances may require you to make a check involving both
        advantage dice and penalties. When making such a check, roll your d20s,
        choose one of the results to use, and apply modifiers and penalties as
        you would for any other check.</p><h2>Example:</h2><blockquote><p>A monk
        has a trait that gives them one advantage die on DEX checks to escape
        from rope bindings. However, they’ve been captured by bandits, tied to a
        chair, and badly injured during a vicious interrogation. The GM rules
        that this imposes a -5 penalty on all checks.</p><p>The player makes a
        DEX check with a CR of 12 to slip free from the ropes. They roll two
        d20s, which land on 12 and 13. They choose to use the 13, then add their
        adventurer’s DEX (+3) for a total of 16. This would be a success were it
        not for the -5 penalty, which reduces their total to 11.</p><p>GM: You
        manage to undo the bonds, but as you shrug off the ropes, you knock over
        the chair you were tied to.</p><p>The noise draws attention, and you
        hear the footfalls of your bandit captors approaching your
        cell...</p><p>The adventurer isn’t out of danger just
        yet!</p></blockquote><h1>Opposition Checks</h1><p>Sometimes two or more
        characters take conflicting actions, each hoping to achieve diﬀerent
        ends. In such cases, the outcome is determined by making an opposition
        check.</p><p>In an opposition check, all characters involved make a
        check appropriate for the action they’re attempting and compare their
        totals. The character with the highest total succeeds in their
        attempt.</p><p>When this results in a tie, oftentimes nothing will
        happen— the situation simply remains as it was before the check was
        made. However, ties may also lead to complex or unexpected outcomes,
        such as all characters succeeding in their eﬀorts or collectively
        failing spectacularly. The GM will use the scenario and their own
        judgment to determine what happens in such cases.</p><h2>Example
        1:</h2><blockquote><p>A dragoon and a bard spot gil lying in the middle
        of the road and race to pick it up. To determine which character reaches
        the fallen coin first, the GM has them make an opposition check using
        DEX.</p><p>The dragoon’s player rolls a 3 and adds their adven- turer’s
        DEX (+3) for a total of 6.</p><p>At the same time, the bard’s player
        rolls a 2 and adds their adventurer’s DEX (+4) for a total of
        6.</p><p>As both players ended up with the same total, the check results
        in a stalemate!</p><p>Thinking it would make for an amusing story, the
        GM decides that both players reach the gil at the same time.</p><p>In
        their haste to snatch it up, they inadvertently launch the gil
        heavensward, and watch, stunned, as it disappears into the
        distance.</p></blockquote><h2>Example 2:</h2><blockquote><p>The selfsame
        dragoon and bard search frantically to find the lost gil. To determine
        which character finds it first, the GM has them make an opposition check
        using MND.</p><p>The dragoon’s player rolls a 13 and adds their
        adventurer’s MND (+1) for a total of 14.</p><p>The bard, however, has a
        trait that gives them one advantage die on MND checks to find objects
        that gleam or glitter. Their player rolls two d20s, which land on 8 and
        4. They choose to use the 8, and add their adventurer’s MND (+2) for a
        total of 10.</p><p>As the dragoon’s total exceeds the bard’s, the
        dragoon finds the gil first, slips it into their purse, and skips
        merrily away along the road, humming a jovial ditty. The bard slumps
        their shoulders in defeat, disappointed to have lost their
        prize.</p></blockquote><h1>Adventurers</h1><p>Adventurers are the
        avatars through which players can experience the wondrous adventures
        that await them on Hydaelyn.</p><p>Before starting the game, you’ll need
        to prepare an adventurer sheet that summarizes everything you need to
        know about your adventurer. Three types of information determine who
        your adventurer is and what they can do: their job, their attributes,
        and their profile.</p><p>Similar info exists for NPCs and monsters, but
        is often abbre- viated. NPCs and monsters may also have features that
        player characters do not.</p><h2>Jobs</h2><p>Every adventurer has a job
        that determines their attributes, traits, and abilities.</p><p>As your
        adventurer explores the world and overcomes challenges and mighty foes,
        their job will level up. Leveling up an adventurer’s job can grant them
        new traits and abilities, or alter the eﬀects of those they already
        have. Your GM will let you know in advance what level of adventurer to
        prepare in order to tackle a given scenario.</p><h2>Roles</h2><p>Jobs
        are divided into diﬀerent roles which help define their responsibilities
        during encounters. The three roles are tank, healer, and DPS.</p><p>The
        most common light party—a party of four adventurers—is composed of one
        healer, one tank, and two DPS characters.</p><p>Oﬃcial scenarios are
        often designed with this party size and composition in
        mind.</p><h3>Tanks</h3><p>Tanks are stalwart defenders who shield the
        party from danger. By drawing enmity and bearing the brunt of their
        enemies’ attacks, they allow their allies to maneuver and
        excel.</p><h3>Healers</h3><p>Whether it be restoring HP or removing
        enfeeblements, healers are the ones who keep the party fighting fit.
        Their support is often key to victory.</p><h3>DPS</h3><p>DPS characters
        are the damage dealers of the party.</p><p>Though they vary in their
        methodology, they all share the ability to bring their enemies
        low.</p><h1>Traits</h1><p>Traits are special characteristics and talents
        your adventurer possesses. Unless otherwise stated, traits are always
        active, and their eﬀects cannot be lost or
        removed.</p><h2>Size</h2><p>Characters occupy space within the world of
        Hydaelyn, and as such, possess a size trait that approximates their
        physical dimensions. Most adventurers are medium size, which means they
        take up a 1x1 square of space on an encounter map.</p><p>NPCs and
        monsters come in all shapes and sizes, and may be much larger or smaller
        than an adventurer. For more information on the diﬀerent sizes in this
        game, see page 13.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>Abilities are the diﬀerent
        skills and spells your adventurer can wield during encounters. Unlike
        traits, abilities must be used to take eﬀect.</p><p>Abilities can also
        be used outside of an encounter, though doing so requires the GM’s
        approval. For more information on abilities, see page
        13.</p><h2>Additional Traits and Abilities</h2><p>Over the course of a
        scenario, adventurers may learn or discover additional traits and
        abilities. Unless otherwise stated, these additional traits and
        abilities can only be used during the scenario in which they’re
        obtained.</p><p>If you feel that an exception should be made, and that
        doing so will make the story more enjoyable for everyone involved, don’t
        hesitate to share your opinion with the GM and the other players. If
        everyone agrees, you may carry over additional traits and abilities from
        previous scenarios or add new traits or abilities to your
        game.</p><h1>Attributes</h1><p>An adventurer’s attributes determine
        their strengths and weak- nesses. The higher an attribute, the more
        capable the adventurer is at performing related actions.</p><h2>Primary
        Attributes</h2><p>Primary attributes are a numerical representation of a
        character’s physical and mental characteristics. While an average popoto
        farmer’s primary attributes are unlikely to exceed 0, adventurers are
        exceptional beings and their primary attributes reflect this.</p><p>Keep
        in mind that most of the checks you make during the game will rely on
        your primary attributes.</p><h3>STR</h3><p>STR represents your
        adventurer’s athleticism, physical fitness, and the raw power they can
        bring to bear.</p><p>This attribute is used when employing physical
        force to overcome a situation, such as lifting a boulder, pushing or
        pulling a laden cart, or kicking down a door.</p><h3>DEX</h3><p>DEX
        represents your adventurer’s coordination, agility, reflexes, and
        balance.</p><p>This attribute is used when sneaking, performing preci-
        sion tasks, or traversing narrow ledges.</p><h3>VIT</h3><p>VIT
        represents your adventurer’s hardiness, physical health, and
        endurance.</p><p>This attribute is used when holding one’s breath,
        perform- ing manual labor for long periods of time, or attempting to
        survive in a desert without water.</p><h3>INT</h3><p>INT represents your
        adventurer’s sharpness of mind, ability to recall information, and
        reasoning skills.</p><p>This attribute is used when attempting to reach
        a logical conclusion, trying to remember a relevant fact, or searching
        for hidden objects.</p><h3>MND</h3><p>MND represents your adventurer’s
        perceptiveness, instincts, and intuition.</p><p>This attribute is used
        when discerning someone’s intent from their gestures, understanding how
        another person is feeling, noticing when something is out of place, or
        treating another character’s wounds.</p><h2>Secondary
        Attributes</h2><p>Secondary attributes are most frequently used during
        encounters, although they are occasionally used for checks outside of
        encounters as well.</p><p>Like primary attributes, an adventurer’s
        secondary attributes are determined by their job and traits. However, in
        rare cases, an adventurer’s personal history and background can
        influence their secondary attributes as
        well.</p><h3>Defense</h3><p>Defense represents your adventurer’s ability
        to withstand physical forces.</p><p>This attribute is often used as the
        CR for the ability checks an enemy makes when attacking your adventurer
        with a physical ability.</p><h3>Magic Defense</h3><p>Magic Defense
        represents your adventurer’s ability to with- stand magical
        forces.</p><p>This attribute is often used as the CR for the ability
        checks an enemy makes when attacking your adventurer with a magic
        ability.</p><h3>Speed</h3><p>Speed represents the distance your
        adventurer can move on their turn when performing a standard movement
        action.</p><h3>Vigilance</h3><p>Vigilance is a passive attribute that
        represents how aware your adventurer is of their surroundings at any
        given time.</p><p>This attribute is typically not used to make checks;
        rather, the GM will use an adventurer’s Vigilance to determine what they
        notice about their environment. Be sure to tell the GM your adventurer’s
        Vigilance when starting a new scenario.</p><h3>Max HP</h3><p>Max HP
        determines how much HP your adventurer has. If their HP ever falls to
        zero, they lose consciousness and are unable to continue participating
        in an encounter.</p><p>As HP is not a measure of wellness or physique,
        an adventurer’s vitality does not influence their Max HP. For
        moreinformation on HP, see page 18.</p><h3>Max MP</h3><p>Max MP
        determines how much MP your adventurer has.</p><p>Some abilities require
        adventurers to spend MP to use them. In most cases, characters have a
        Max MP of 5.</p><h1>Adventurer Profile</h1><p>Your adventurer is more
        than a walking collection of numbers— they’re a living, breathing part
        of the world. That’s why every adventurer has a profile that describes
        the kind of person they are.</p><p>Consider the following questions when
        writing your adventurer’s profile:</p><ul><li><p>What race are
        they?</p></li><li><p>What do they look like?</p></li><li><p>Where were
        they born, and how were they raised?</p></li><li><p>Why did they decide
        to become an adventurer?</p></li><li><p>What are their likes and
        dislikes?</p></li><li><p>Do they have any friends or
        family?</p></li></ul><p>Be sure to consult with the GM and the other
        players to ensure your profile is appropriate to the scenario before you
        begin playing.</p><p>While your adventurer’s profile will only rarely
        influence game mechanics such as traits or secondary attributes, the
        information it contains can have a significant impact on how a
        scenario’s story unfolds.</p><p>Say your current quest requires you to
        speak with an Ala Mhigan refugee. If a member of your party is a fellow
        Ala Mhigan, the refugee might be more receptive to lending you
        aid.</p><p>Conversely, if you visit a settlement where people hold a
        grudge against Gridania due to an incident several years prior, they
        won’t be happy to see an adventurer belonging to the Wood Wailers. In
        some cases, they may even become hostile and attack!</p><p>As per the
        golden rule, the GM has the final say about how an adventurer’s profile
        impacts the story. If the GM is concerned as to how certain information
        in a profile could aﬀect the game, it’s often best to ignore it. If, for
        example, an adventurer’s profile mentions that they’re the illegitimate
        child of Buscarron—proprietor of Buscarron’s</p><p>Druthers—it’s
        perfectly all right for the GM to have Buscarron address this adventurer
        as a complete stranger should you visit his alehouse in the Upper
        Paths.</p><p>It may be that the adventurer is a habitual liar, or
        Buscarron and his scion could have a reason to pretend they don’t know
        each other.</p><p>The GM is free to advance the story without exploring
        this alleged familial relationship.</p><h2>Titles</h2><p>Titles serve as
        a record of an adventurer’s deeds and accomplishments, and are a
        rewarding way to track a character’s journey across Eorzea and
        beyond.</p><p>Titles aren’t just for show—they can also have a tangible
        eﬀect on the story. An adventurer’s bearing subtly shifts when using a
        title, allowing NPCs within the game world to intuit what that title is.
        This may cause them to behave diﬀerently towards that character—for
        better or for worse.</p><p>In rare cases, a title may even grant eﬀects
        that influence the mechanics of the game itself. Keep in mind that the
        GM has final say on whether a title aﬀects the game.</p><p>Adventurers
        may possess as many titles as they can earn, but can only use one title
        at any given time. Using a title is optional, but unused titles will not
        have an eﬀect on the scenario.</p><p>Titles can be swapped while resting
        or sleeping, but cannot be changed otherwise.</p><h2>Supplementary
        Profile Fields</h2><p>Character profiles also contain additional fields
        for supplementary information. More information on supplementary profile
        fields can be found in the Standard Rulebook.</p>

        <h1>The Basics</h1><p>Encounters are urgent situations in which the
        specifics of each character’s actions take center stage. These can
        include clashes with monsters, tense escapes from crumbling ruins, or
        even desperate struggles for the very fate of the star. Encounters take
        place on an encounter map, upon which participating characters battle
        and maneuver. A square grid should be used to represent the encounter
        map, with miniatures or other markers to keep track of character
        positions.</p><p>Encounters are divided up into three distinct units of
        time: phases, rounds, and turns. Most encounters have only one phase,
        but special or complex encounters may be composed of multiple phases.
        For more information on phases, see page 18.</p><h2>Starting an
        Encounter</h2><p>Before starting the first round of an encounter,
        determine the following:</p><ol><li><p>Surprise: The GM determines
        whether any of the characters participating in the encounter have been
        caught by surprise.</p></li><li><p>Positioning: The GM determines the
        positions of all enemies participating in the encounter and places them
        in the appropriate squares of the map. Depending on the scenario, the GM
        will either specify a starting area in which the players may freely
        place their adventurers, or place the adventurers in specific
        locations.</p></li><li><p>Turn Order: Players determine the order in
        which their adventurers and allies take their turns. This is referred to
        as the turn order. The turn order for enemies is determined by the
        scenario, or left to the discretion of the GM. The GM may choose to
        share this information with the other players, but is not required to do
        so. Once the turn order has been set, it cannot be changed for the
        duration of the encounter, unless otherwise
        specified.</p></li></ol><h2>Rounds</h2><p>A round refers to the period
        of time in which all characters participating in an encounter take a
        single turn.</p><p>Each round is composed of the following three
        steps:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Adventurer Step</strong>: Each adventurer
        and allied character participating in the encounter takes a turn,
        following the turn order. If the encounter hasn’t ended after they have
        done so, proceed to the [Enemy Step].</p></li><li><p><strong>Enemy
        Step</strong>: Each enemy participating in the encounter takes a turn.
        If the encounter hasn’t ended after they have done so, end the
        round.</p></li><li><p><strong>End of Round Step</strong>: The current
        round ends, a new round begins, and the order of play starts over at the
        <strong>Adventurer Step</strong>.</p></li></ol><p>At the end of each
        step, the GM determines if the encounter continues. If the adventurers
        have made it out of danger or have defeated all enemy characters, the
        encounter ends or proceeds to the next phase.</p><p>Sometimes, a
        character’s abilities, enhancements, or enfeeblements will have eﬀects
        that activate or need to be resolved at the end of a given step. Always
        resolve eﬀects that impact adventurers before resolving those that aﬀect
        enemies. Should multiple eﬀects need to be resolved simultaneously, the
        adventurers may decide the order in which to do so.</p><p>When there are
        multiple hostile factions participating in an encounter, all the
        characters from one faction will take their turns, followed by those of
        the next faction. The turn order for factions is determined by the GM,
        and cannot be changed for the duration of the
        encounter.</p><h2>Surprise</h2><p>Certain situations may cause an
        encounter to begin with one faction taking the other by surprise. If,
        for example, a hidden enemy launches an attack against the adventurers,
        any characters caught by surprise cannot act on their turn or use
        instant abilities during the first round of the encounter.</p><p>Be
        aware that it is possible for some characters belonging to a faction to
        be taken by surprise while other characters are not. The GM will
        determine which characters are caught by surprise in any given
        encounter.</p><h2>Turns</h2><p>When a character is involved in an
        encounter, they may perform several diﬀerent actions during their turn.
        Each turn, they can perform one of each of the
        following:</p><ul><li><p>A primary action</p></li><li><p>A secondary
        action</p></li><li><p>Standard movement or focus</p></li></ul><p>You may
        choose the order in which your adventurer performs these actions, or opt
        to end your turn without performing some or all of them. When there are
        no further actions you can or wish to take on your turn, declare your
        turn to be finished and proceed to either the next adventurer’s turn or
        the next step of the round.</p><p>The GM will also take turns for NPCs
        and monsters in the manner described above.</p><h3>Primary
        Actions</h3><p>On a character’s turn, they may perform one of the
        following primary actions:</p><ul><li><p>Use a primary
        ability</p></li><li><p>Use a primary item</p></li><li><p>Sprint,
        doubling the character’s Speed for this turn</p></li><li><p>Perform any
        other action specified by the scenario or the GM to be a primary
        action</p></li><li><p>Perform a secondary
        action</p></li></ul><p></p><h4><strong>Combo
        Abilities</strong></h4><p>Some abilities have special eﬀects that allow
        you to use an additional primary ability, exceeding the usual limit of
        one primary action per turn. These abilities are referred to as combo
        abilities, and will specify the additional abilities you may choose
        from. While you are not required to use an additional ability, you
        cannot use an ability that is not indicated by the combo
        ability.</p><h3>Secondary Actions</h3><p>On a character’s turn, they may
        perform one of the following secondary actions:</p><ul><li><p>Use a
        secondary ability</p></li><li><p>Use a secondary
        item</p></li><li><p>Perform any other action specified by the scenario
        or the GM to be a secondary action</p></li></ul><h3>Standard
        Movement</h3><p>Characters often need to remain mobile during encounters
        to stay out of harm’s way or position themselves more favorably. By
        using a standard movement action, a character can move between diﬀerent
        squares during their turn so long as the number of squares traversed
        does not exceed their Speed. Moving into an adjacent square costs one
        square of movement, regardless of whether that square is orthogonally or
        diagonally adjacent. When counting squares for movement, do not include
        your starting square.</p><p>Characters cannot pass through squares that
        contain an enemy, unless that enemy is smaller in size than that
        character (see page 13). However, they may pass through squares occupied
        by allied or neutral characters, regardless of size. Additionally, a
        character cannot end a standard movement action in a square occupied by
        another character. If a character would run out of movement in a square
        in which another character is present, they cannot enter that
        square.</p><p>You may also choose to split up a character’s standard
        movement and have them pause to perform primary or secondary actions.
        Afterwards, they are free to continue their move, as long as they have
        movement left to use.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong> An
        adventurer with a Speed of five squares begins their turn. They move two
        squares, perform a primary action, move one square, and then perform a
        secondary action. Finally, they use the last two squares of their
        standard movement action to move again before ending their
        turn.</p></blockquote><h3>Focus</h3><p>A character may forgo all
        standard movement during their turn to focus. This allows them to
        perform an additional secondary action, for a total of two secondary
        actions in a single turn. The character stands still to focus on their
        actions and can’t spare a thought for mobility.</p><p>Free Actions In
        addition to a primary action, a secondary action, and a standard
        movement action, a character may also perform one free action during
        their turn, provided that action is permitted by the rules and the GM.
        Free actions typically involve doing something simple, like opening a
        door, picking up an item, or sounding a warning whistle.</p><p>The GM is
        the final arbiter on whether or not an action can be carried out as a
        free action, but in general, it’s safe to assume that anything that can
        be accomplished almost instantaneously and with a negligible chance of
        failure can be performed as a free action. Any action that takes even a
        little time—such as unlocking a coﬀer or turning a crank to lower a
        drawbridge—or that requires the character to make a check must be
        performed as a primary action.</p><h3>Instant
        Abilities</h3><p>Characters can react to the ever-changing circumstances
        of an encounter by using instant abilities. Unlike other abilities,
        instant abilities may be used during any character’s turn, provided
        their trigger conditions are met. However, a character cannot use
        instant abilities when they are surprised, nor can they use multiple
        instant abilities on a given
        turn.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong> During an enemy’s
        turn, a warrior uses Interject in response to an ability used by that
        enemy. They cannot then use Thrill of Battle, another instant ability,
        in response to that same ability, as it is still the same character’s
        turn. They may, however, use Thrill of Battle in response to another
        ability on the next character’s turn.</p></blockquote><p>If an instant
        ability is used during another character’s turn, that character can
        continue their turn as soon as the instant ability’s eﬀect is
        resolved.</p><img
        src="modules/foundryvtt-final-fantasy-XIV-player-bookbook/assets/pages/instant-ability.webp"
        /><h2>Movement Effects</h2><p>Movement that occurs as a result of an
        ability’s eﬀect, a character trait, or an encounter mechanic is referred
        to as a movement eﬀect. This is considered distinct from standard
        movement. For this reason, a character can still move via a movement
        eﬀect even after using all of their standard movement. Movement eﬀects
        do not change the distance a character can move when performing a
        standard movement action on a given turn; they are simply a secondary
        source of mobility.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong> A
        dragoon uses the Elusive Jump ability as a secondary action, which
        allows them to move five squares. As they have not used any of their
        standard movement, they may still travel as far as their Speed allows,
        or choose to focus and perform an additional secondary
        action.</p></blockquote><p>Unless otherwise specified, a movement eﬀect
        cannot cause a character to stop in a square occupied by another
        character, even temporarily. This applies to abilities and traits that
        move other characters as well.</p><p>If resolving an eﬀect results in a
        situation where multiple characters end up in the same square, refer to
        the following section on size for more information on how to
        proceed.</p><h2>Character Size</h2><p>Depending on their size,
        characters take up diﬀerent amounts of space. The table below shows how
        much space characters of each size take up during an encounter. This
        table can also be used to determine the size of inanimate objects that
        take up space on the encounter
        map.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Size</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Space
        Occupied</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Size</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Space
        Occupied</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Small</p></td><td><p>1x1
        square</p></td><td><p>Medium</p></td><td><p>1x1
        square</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Large</p></td><td><p>2x2
        square</p></td><td><p>Huge</p></td><td><p>3x3
        square</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Colossal</p></td><td><p>4x4
        squares</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The
        space occupied by a character represents the number of squares that
        character controls in an encounter. Most medium- sized characters aren’t
        so broad as to physically fill an entire square, but their ability to
        take a swing at or push back any foes who encroach on their space causes
        them to take up one full square.</p><p>Consider the following: Two
        medium-sized Sahagin are standing side by side in a passageway two
        squares wide. Their enemies—a small-sized character and a medium-sized
        character—cannot pass by the Sahagin without running afoul of their
        tridents. A large-sized character, however, could shove past them
        without issue.</p><img
        src="modules/foundryvtt-final-fantasy-XIV-player-book/assets/pages/creature-space-occupied.webp"
        /><p>If resolving an eﬀect results in a situation where multiple
        characters end up in the same square, the GM will move one or more
        characters to the closest unoccupied square.</p><p>If a square is
        occupied by characters of diﬀering sizes, the GM moves the smaller of
        the characters to a diﬀerent square; if the characters are the same
        size, but one is an adventurer and the other an NPC, the GM moves the
        adventurer. Otherwise, the GM chooses which character to
        move.</p><p>Some scenarios may specify which characters to move and
        where to move them. However, it is ultimately up to the GM’s discretion
        to determine how characters should be moved.</p><p>Any characters
        repositioned by the GM are knocked oﬀ their feet, leaving them Prone
        (see page 20). Repositioning a character in this manner is not
        considered movement.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>Abilities are a key
        component of any encounter, and characters can use them to aﬀect the
        world in a number of diﬀerent ways. Each ability is comprised of the
        following fields, though some abilities may not include all of the
        fields described below. If an ability’s description does not contain a
        certain field, the ability does not possess that field.</p><p>If an
        ability requires an ability check, the player responsible for the
        character using the ability must make a check before resolving its
        eﬀects. Depending on the outcome of the check, the ability’s eﬀects may
        change.</p><h3>Name</h3><p>The ability’s
        name.</p><h2>Type</h2><h4><strong>Primary, Secondary,
        Instant</strong></h4><ul><li><p>Abilities are separated into diﬀerent
        types, which indicate how and when they can be used.</p></li><li><p>As
        explained in the section on turns, primary abilities can be used as a
        primary action, and secondary abilities can be used as a secondary
        action. Instant abilities can be used whenever their trigger conditions
        are met—even on another character’s turn.</p></li><li><p>Certain special
        abilities do not belong to any of the above types. Their descriptions
        will explain how and when they can be
        used.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Physical, Magic,
        Unique</strong></h4><ul><li><p>Abilities are further classified as
        physical, magic, or unique. This classification aﬀects the CR of the
        ability check made when the ability is used. For more information on
        ability checks, see page 15.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Other
        Classifications</strong></h4><ul><li><p>Some abilities have other
        classifications, indicating whether the ability is invoked,
        fire-aspected, and so forth. This information may be referenced by
        character traits or other abilities.</p></li></ul><h3>Cost</h3><p>The
        cost that must be paid in order to use the ability. An ability cannot be
        used if a character lacks the resources to pay its cost, or if expending
        those resources would render them incapable of using
        it.</p><p>Typically, abilities with a cost require their user to spend a
        certain amount of MP. However, some abilities draw on resources other
        than MP.</p><p>Abilities without a cost listed do not have one, unless
        otherwise detailed in their description.</p><h3>Requirement</h3><p>Some
        abilities have requirements that must be met before they can be
        used.</p><h3>Target</h3><p>The character, characters, or objects the
        ability aﬀects.</p><h4><strong>X:</strong></h4><p>The ability aﬀects X
        characters chosen by the user within the ability’s range. These targets
        may be enemies or allies, or even objects such as doors and barricades,
        provided the GM permits it. For the purposes of targeting, the user is
        considered to be an ally.</p><h4>Self:</h4><p>The ability aﬀects the
        user.</p><h4>Enemy/Ally:</h4><p>The ability aﬀects one or more enemies
        or allies. Potential targets are determined based on whether the user
        considers them an enemy or ally at the time the ability is used. A
        character could, for example, use an ability that targets an ally on a
        monster that was considered an enemy at the start of the encounter, but
        has since turned out to be an ally. For the purposes of targeting, the
        user is considered to be an ally.</p><h4>Special:</h4><p>Abilities that
        do not aﬀect characters—such as those that create or conjure
        something—may not have specified targets. Refer to the ability’s base
        eﬀect and direct hit descriptions when resolving these
        abilities.</p><h3>Range</h3><p>The distance at which the ability can be
        used and the number of squares it aﬀects. Abilities do not aﬀect targets
        that move out of range before its eﬀects are resolved. For example, a
        target could avoid an ability by using a trait or ability of their own
        to flee to safety. Abilities which target their user do not have a
        range. The following examples illustrate common ability ranges:</p><h4>5
        squares:</h4><ul><li><p>The ability aﬀects one or more targets within
        five squares of the user.</p></li></ul><h4>A 3x3 area centered on this
        character:</h4><ul><li><p>The ability aﬀects all targets within a 3x3
        area centered on the user.</p></li></ul><h4>A 3x3 area adjacent to this
        character:</h4><ul><li><p>The ability aﬀects all targets in a 3x3 area
        that does not include the user but with at least one square adjacent to
        them.</p></li></ul><h4>A 5x5 area within 10 squares of this
        character:</h4><ul><li><p>The ability aﬀects all targets in a 5x5 area
        whose furthest square is no more than ten squares away from the
        user.</p></li></ul><h3>Check</h3><p>The values used for ability checks
        (see page 15) made when using the ability.</p><p>Abilities without this
        field can be used without making an ability check. When a character uses
        the ability, simply resolve its base eﬀect.</p><p>If an ability check is
        listed as “Special,” refer to the ability’s base eﬀect description for
        more information. These abilities do not have a CR or a direct hit
        eﬀect, and often require an ability check simply to see if you score a
        critical or if a proc eﬀect is triggered.</p><h3>CR</h3><p>The challenge
        rating (CR) for a physical ability’s check will always be the target’s
        Defense, whereas the CR for a magic ability’s check will always be the
        target’s Magic Defense, unless otherwise stated.</p><ul><li><p>Physical
        Ability CR = Target’s Defense</p></li><li><p>Magic Ability CR = Target’s
        Magic Defense</p></li></ul><p>The CR for a unique ability’s check can be
        found in the ability’s description, in the scenario, or in the
        character’s traits.</p><img
        src="modules/foundryvtt-final-fantasy-XIV-player-book/assets/pages/area-effects.webp"
        /><h3>Base Effect</h3><p>The eﬀect that is resolved when the ability is
        used. An ability’s base eﬀect is always fully resolved, unless something
        interrupts or otherwise negates the use of the ability
        itself.</p><h3>Direct Hit</h3><p>An additional eﬀect that is resolved
        when the character scores a direct hit with the
        ability.</p><h3>Limitation</h3><p>Indicates how many times the ability
        can be used in a given period of time. It may also describe other
        restrictions or condi- tions. Unless otherwise stated, abilities may not
        be used more times than explicitly indicated here.</p><h2>Ability
        Checks</h2><p>Many abilities require players to make an ability check
        when used.</p><p>The check field indicates the value, often a primary
        attribute, to be used for this check. It will also specify the check’s
        CR.</p><p>If the ability check’s total equals or exceeds the CR, the
        ability scores a direct hit, and the eﬀect described in its direct hit
        field is resolved alongside its base eﬀect.</p><p>Some abilities have
        “Special” listed in their check or CR fields. In these cases, the result
        of an ability check or d20 roll may be referenced when resolving the
        ability’s eﬀect.</p><h2>Rolling for Ability Effects</h2><p>Abilities
        that deal damage or heal HP often require a dice roll to determine how
        potent their eﬀects are. After making any required ability checks, roll
        the dice specified in the ability’s base eﬀect and, when applicable,
        direct hit descriptions. Use the sum of their results to calculate the
        amount of damage dealt or HP healed.</p><h2>Criticals</h2><p>If a d20
        rolled for an ability check lands on a 20, then that ability is a
        critical. On the d20s included in the Starter Set, 20 is represented by
        the <span class="icon-icomoon"></span> icon.</p><p>Ability checks that
        result in a critical always score a direct hit regardless of CR,
        assuming the ability has a direct hit eﬀect. Furthermore, criticals
        double the number of dice rolled to determine the amount of damage dealt
        or HP healed by the ability’s eﬀects, including any additional dice
        awarded by traits or abilities. All other numbers for the ability remain
        unchanged.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example 1</strong>: A warrior uses
        their Tomahawk ability, which has a base eﬀect that deals 2 points of
        damage plus an additional 1d6 damage on a direct hit. The player rolls a
        20 on Tomahawk’s ability check, making it both a critical and a direct
        hit. Because of the critical, the player doubles the dice and rolls 2d6,
        then adds 2 to the sum to calculate the total damage
        dealt.</p><p><strong>Example 2</strong>: A dragoon uses their Jump
        ability, which deals 2d6 + 3 damage from its base eﬀect plus an
        additional 2d6 damage on a direct hit—a total of 4d6 + 3. The player
        rolls a 20 on Jump’s ability check, making it both a critical and a
        direct hit. Because of the critical, the player doubles the dice and
        rolls 8d6, then adds 3 to the sum to calculate the total damage
        dealt.</p></blockquote><h2>Ability Checks for Multiple Targets</h2><p>If
        a character uses an ability that aﬀects multiple targets, make a single
        ability check and use the resulting total to determine if the ability
        scores a direct hit on each target.</p><p>If the character has been
        granted advantage dice on ability checks against some targets but not
        others, roll the advantage dice for those targets separately and select
        which die to use when calculating the total of the check for those
        specific targets.</p><h2>Damage and Healing for Multiple
        Targets</h2><p>If an ability that deals damage or heals HP aﬀects
        multiple targets, roll the dice once and use the resulting total to
        calculate the amount of damage dealt or HP healed. Each target suﬀers
        the same amount of damage or recovers the same amount of HP.</p><p>If
        the ability check resulted in a critical for some targets but not
        others, roll the additional dice once and add the results to the total
        from the first roll to calculate the eﬀects for those specific
        targets.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong> A black mage uses
        Fire II to target three enemies: Star Marmot A, Star Marmot B, and a
        little ladybug. The player makes a single ability check using their
        adventurer’s INT, resulting in a total of 11. The ability check’s CR is
        determined by the target’s Magic Defense, which is 10 for the star
        marmots and 12 for the little ladybug. As such, the ability scores a
        direct hit on the star marmots, but not on the little ladybug. Fire II’s
        base eﬀect deals 3 damage to all three targets, but because the ability
        scored a direct hit on the two star marmots, they also take an
        additional 1d6 damage. The player rolls 1d6 to determine direct hit
        damage, which lands on a 4. The two star marmots suﬀer a total of 7
        damage each, while the little ladybug only suﬀers 3 damage from Fire
        II’s base eﬀect.</p></blockquote><h2>Proc Effects</h2><p>Some abilities
        have additional proc eﬀects that trigger if a d20— either the one rolled
        for their ability check or another rolled at a time specified in their
        base eﬀect description—lands on a specific number. Whether or not a proc
        eﬀect is triggered is determined by the unmodified value of the die
        rolled.</p><p>When a proc eﬀect is triggered, resolve the eﬀects
        specified in the ability’s base eﬀect and direct hit
        descriptions.</p><h1>Ability Resolution</h1><p>Follow these steps when
        using an ability:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Choose Ability:</strong> Select
        one of your character’s abilities to use.</p></li><li><p><strong>Select
        Target:</strong> If the ability requires a target or targets, select
        them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Confirm Ability Check:</strong> If the
        ability requires you to make an ability check, confirm the relevant
        values and the check’s CR, as well as whether any advantage dice or
        penalties apply.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make Ability Check:</strong>
        Make the ability check using the information from step
        3.</p></li><li><p><strong>Determine Results:</strong> Use the total from
        step 4 to determine if the ability is a direct hit and if any proc
        eﬀects are triggered. If you rolled a 20, the ability is a
        critical.</p></li><li><p><strong>Confirm Eﬀects:</strong> Confirm the
        ability’s base eﬀect, as well as its direct hit eﬀect, if applicable. If
        the ability check resulted in a critical, the dice used to determine
        ability eﬀect values are doubled. Lastly, if a proc eﬀect was triggered,
        confirm its eﬀects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Roll Dice:</strong> If any
        part of the ability’s eﬀects require you to roll any dice, do so
        now.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resolve Eﬀects:</strong> Resolve the eﬀects
        confirmed in step 6 for the ability’s target, targets, or all targets
        within the ability’s range. Use the results of the dice rolled in step 7
        when applicable.</p></li></ol><h1>Markers</h1><p>Some abilities have
        eﬀects that generate markers. Markers serve as visual cues that provide
        advance notice of what is about to occur on the encounter map. When a
        marker is generated, an object or token should be placed on the
        encounter map to represent that marker.</p><p>Each marker is comprised
        of the following fields. If a field is blank, the marker does not
        possess that field.</p><h4>Source</h4><p>The ability or eﬀect that
        generated the marker.</p><h4>Creator</h4><p>The character that used the
        ability that generated the marker. If the creator is aﬄicted with an
        enfeeblement that renders them unable to maintain the marker, the marker
        is removed from the encounter map. Refer to the list of enfeeblements on
        page 20 to determine if a given enfeeblement would cause the removal of
        a marker.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example 1</strong>: The party is
        fighting Ifrit, who uses the Eruption ability. The GM places a 5x5
        square marker on the encounter map as specified in the ability’s
        description. In this instance, Eruption is the source of the marker, and
        Ifrit is the marker’s creator.</p><img
        src="modules/foundryvtt-final-fantasy-XIV-player-book/assets/pages/marker-generated.webp"
        alt="Ifrit uses Eruption, generating a marker " /><p><strong>Example
        2</strong>: To represent a collapsing ceiling inside of a crumbling
        mine, the GM places multiple markers on the encounter map to indicate
        danger areas where rocks will fall. In this case, the collapsing ceiling
        is the source of the markers, and there is no creator.</p><img
        src="modules/foundryvtt-final-fantasy-XIV-player-book/assets/pages/rocks-generating-marker.webp"
        alt="Rocks fall from the ceiling generating markers"
        /></blockquote><h4>Marker Type</h4><p>All markers are classified as
        mobile or stationary.</p><p>A mobile marker may change location or size
        before its eﬀects are resolved, as long as the conditions noted in the
        source ability’s description are met.</p><p>Stationary markers, on the
        other hand, are immobile and will remain in the square or squares in
        which they were generated until their eﬀects are
        resolved.</p><h4>Origin</h4><p>The location in which the marker is
        placed on the encounter map. A marker’s origin can be one or more
        characters or squares on the encounter map.</p><h4>Marker
        Area</h4><p>The total area that the marker will aﬀect. This field also
        indicates the conditions under which a mobile marker changes
        location.</p><p>The GM will decide whether or not they convey to the
        other players how a given mobile marker moves based on instructions in
        the scenario or by using their own
        discretion.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example</strong>: A mobile marker
        with a 3x3 area centered on the origin and that moves with the origin is
        placed on the encounter map. If the character that served as the
        marker’s origin moves using a standard movement action, a movement
        eﬀect, or is otherwise repositioned due to a special game rule, the
        marker moves along with the character so that the 3x3 area is always
        centered on them.</p><img
        src="modules/foundryvtt-final-fantasy-XIV-player-book/assets/pages/mobile-marker.webp"
        alt="mobile marker" width="200" height="200"
        /></blockquote><h4>Target</h4><p>The character, characters, or objects
        the marker aﬀects.</p><h4>Marker Trigger</h4><p>The conditions under
        which the marker’s eﬀect is resolved. When these conditions are met, the
        marker’s eﬀect is resolved for all valid targets within the marker
        area.</p><h4>Marker Effect</h4><p>The eﬀect that is resolved when the
        marker trigger’s conditions are met. This field describes both the eﬀect
        the marker has on its targets as well as any secondary eﬀects the marker
        may have.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, a marker’s eﬀects only apply
        to enemies of its creator. If a marker has no creator, it will aﬀect all
        valid targets within the marker area, unless the rules specify
        otherwise.</p><h2>Marker Resolution</h2><p>Follow these steps when
        generating and resolving a marker:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Generate
        Marker</strong>: When an ability or eﬀect that generates a marker is
        resolved, declare its source and creator.</p></li><li><p><strong>Place
        Marker</strong>: Place an object or token on the encounter map to
        represent the marker to the players, and declare whether it is a mobile
        or stationary marker. If it is a mobile marker and you wish to share
        this information, declare under what conditions this marker will
        move.</p></li><li><p><strong>Confirm Marker Trigger</strong>: Confirm
        the conditions under which the marker’s eﬀect is
        resolved.</p></li><li><p><strong>Declare Marker Activation</strong>:
        When the marker is triggered, inform the players that the marker’s eﬀect
        will be resolved.</p></li><li><p><strong>Confirm Marker Target</strong>:
        Confirm the target or targets of the marker’s
        eﬀects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Confirm Marker Eﬀect</strong>: Confirm
        the marker’s eﬀect. If this requires you to roll any dice, do so
        now.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resolve Eﬀects</strong>: Resolve the eﬀect
        confirmed in step 6 for the marker’s target, targets, or all targets
        within the marker’s area of eﬀect.</p></li></ol><img
        src="modules/foundryvtt-final-fantasy-XIV-player-book/assets/pages/sample-abilities.webp"
        alt="Sample abilities" /><p></p><h2>Phases</h2><p>A phase is a unit of
        time that helps govern an encounter. The length of a single phase can
        vary dramatically depending on how the encounter
        unfolds.</p><p>Typically, a single encounter consists of one phase. Once
        that phase has ended, the encounter ends along with it. However, certain
        special encounters—like those involving especially powerful enemies—may
        have multiple phases.</p><p>In such cases, a new phase will begin once
        the conditions outlined in the scenario are met. This might occur when
        all enemies have been defeated, or when a certain character’s HP has
        been reduced to 0. New phases may see enemy reinforce- ments take the
        field, or have a unique character adopt a more powerful form. In the
        end, it’s up to the GM to decide how to handle phases, and they are free
        to add, subtract, or tweak phases as they see fit.</p><p>Follow these
        steps when a phase ends and a new one
        begins:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Remove enhancements</strong> and
        enfeeblements (see page 20) from all characters, unless otherwise
        specified.</p></li><li><p>The GM places any <strong>additional
        enemies</strong> on the encounter map and adjusts enemy character
        information as necessary.</p></li><li><p>Adventurers and companions with
        <strong>abilities</strong> that have a <strong>limited</strong> number
        of uses per phase have those uses <strong>restored</strong>. Turn order,
        HP, MP, barriers, items consumed, and benefits gained from traits such
        as Umbral Mastery and The Beast Within are carried over to the new
        phase.</p></li><li><p>Each adventurer may immediately
        <strong>use</strong> one of their
        <strong>items</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>At the start of a new phase, the
        encounter map may also change. In such cases, the relative position of
        characters will remain unchanged, so long as it does not specifically
        say to move them in the scenario or elsewhere.</p><p>When indicated by
        the scenario, characters aware that the encounter hasn’t ended may be
        repositioned. Repositioning a character in this manner is not considered
        movement.</p><h2>HP</h2><p>HP is not a measure of a character’s physical
        stamina, but rather a numerical representation of their physical and
        mental resilience and their will to survive. Characters with more HP can
        withstand greater damage, and those with less HP can be defeated more
        easily.</p><p>A character’s HP can range from their <strong>Max
        HP</strong> value to 0, and cannot fall into the negative. When
        characters suﬀer damage or receive healing eﬀects, their HP value will
        change. Outside of an encounter, a character’s HP value will always
        equal their <strong>Max HP</strong>, unless special rules are in
        eﬀect.</p><p>When a character suﬀers damage during an encounter, their
        HP value is reduced by the amount of damage taken. Damage that would
        cause their HP value to fall below 0 instead brings it to 0; any extra
        damage is ignored.</p><p>When a character receives a healing eﬀect,
        their HP value is increased by the amount of HP it restores. Recovery
        that would cause their HP to exceed their <strong>Max HP</strong> value
        instead brings it to their <strong>Max HP</strong> value; any extra
        healing is ignored.</p><p>So long as a character’s HP is not reduced to
        0, losing HP has no eﬀect on a character’s abilities or
        attributes.</p><h3>Barriers</h3><p>Certain abilities can furnish
        characters with barriers that provide additional HP. If a character with
        a barrier takes damage, the damage is first subtracted from the barrier.
        Any damage remaining after the barrier is lost is subtracted from the
        character’s HP. Barriers are considered separate from a character’s HP,
        so it’s possible for a barrier to allow a character to exceed their
        <strong>Max HP</strong>.</p><p>Barriers cannot be restored with healing
        eﬀects, nor can two barriers be combined. If a character with a barrier
        gains another, the barrier with the higher HP value remains active, and
        the one with the lower HP value is lost. So long as the eﬀect granting
        the barrier does not list a specific duration, it will last until damage
        eliminates it or the encounter ends.</p><h3>When HP Falls to
        0</h3><p>When a character’s HP falls to 0, that character is
        <strong>Knocked Out</strong>. A character with 0 HP cannot recover HP
        until the <strong>Knocked Out</strong> enfeeblement is removed via an
        ability such as <strong>Raise</strong>, by using an item such as a
        Company-Issue Tonic, or through some other special eﬀect. When an
        encounter ends, characters who are <strong>Knocked Out</strong> regain
        all of their HP and are aﬄicted with the <strong>Weakened</strong>
        enfeeblement.</p><p>To avoid confusion, the GM may decide that when NPCs
        and monsters reach 0 HP, they <strong>Die</strong> instead of being
        <strong>Knocked Out</strong>.</p><p>If an adventurer reduces a character
        or monster’s HP to 0 but does not want to kill them, that player should
        declare that their adventurer has decided to inflict non-lethal damage
        and merely knocked their adversary out. That being said, the scenario’s
        rules and the GM’s discretion take precedence, so <strong>Knocking
        Out</strong> an enemy may not always be possible. When an enemy is
        <strong>Knocked Out</strong> or killed in an encounter, remove their
        token from the encounter map. When an adventurer is <strong>Knocked
        Out</strong>, however, leave their token where it is.</p><p>Refer to the
        enfeeblements section on page 21 for further infor- mation on what
        happens when a character is <strong>Knocked
        Out</strong>.</p><h3>Describing Damage</h3><p>As explained earlier, HP
        is not a representation of physical stamina. Because of this, a
        character with 1 HP remaining might appear whole and unharmed, and yet
        be just one stiﬀ breeze from death’s door. Alternatively, a character
        covered with countless horrible wounds may in fact be hale and hearty at
        <strong>Max HP</strong>.</p><p>But this presents a problem: how do
        players know whether their adversaries are brimming with life or
        gurgling on the verge of death? It is the rare party that doesn’t want
        to keep tabs on their enemies’ HP. Some GMs prefer to keep enemy HP
        counts to themselves in order to maintain immersion, while others choose
        to be completely transparent, revealing raw numbers to the other
        players.</p><p>For the GM who is looking for a creative solution to this
        particular problem, here are a few helpful suggestions for describing
        enemy HP. Feel free to use them verbatim, or as a springboard to come up
        with your own ideas.</p><blockquote><h4><strong>When an Enemy’s HP Falls
        below 50%</strong></h4><ul><li><p>The enemy’s HP gauge has turned
        yellow.</p></li><li><p>The enemy appears winded, and their movements
        have slowed.</p></li><li><p>A number of cracks and dents now cover the
        warmachina’s chassis.</p></li><li><p>Your foe is left reeling after
        being struck by the bolt of fire you
        summoned.</p></li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><h4>When an Enemy’s HP
        Falls below 10%</h4><ul><li><p>The enemy’s HP gauge is flashing
        red!</p></li><li><p>Sweat drips from your foe’s brow, their pained
        breathing clearly audible.</p></li><li><p>Greasy smoke billows from
        jagged rents in the warmachina’s chassis.</p></li><li><p>It seems your
        foe is struggling to remain standing.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>With
        all of that being said, remember that as a GM, there are countless ways
        to approach this and the other challenges you’ll face, and there are no
        wrong answers. Feel free to experiment and find the methods that work
        best for you and the other players at the table. </p><h2>MP </h2><p>MP
        represents a character’s reserves of mana and their ability to
        manipulate aether, and is often consumed as the cost of using certain
        abilities. An adventurer’s <strong>Max MP</strong> is 5. </p><p>NPCs and
        monsters do not use MP unless specifically stated. </p><p>An
        adventurer’s MP can range from their <strong>Max MP</strong> value to 0,
        and cannot fall into the negative. When adventurers expend or recover
        MP, their MP value will change accordingly. Outside of an encounter, a
        character’s MP value will always equal their <strong>Max MP</strong>,
        unless special rules are in eﬀect. </p><p>When an adventurer uses an
        ability that costs MP, their MP value is reduced by the amount specified
        in the ability’s description. A reduction in MP does not aﬀect a
        character’s abilities or attri- butes, and they can act normally even if
        their MP drops to 0. They simply will be unable to use abilities that
        cost MP . </p><h3>Natural MP Recovery </h3><p>While in an encounter, all
        adventurers will automatically recover 2 MP at the end of a round’s
        [Adventurer Step], before the [Enemy Step] begins. </p><p>Some abilities
        and traits have eﬀects that alter the amount of MP a character recovers
        at the end of the [Adventurer Step]. Be sure to take any such eﬀects
        into account when recovering MP. </p><h2>Limit Breaks </h2><p>Limit
        breaks are special abilities that can be used in encounters of great
        importance or when fighting powerful enemies. </p><p>Whether or not
        limit breaks are available for use depends on the scenario and the GM’s
        discretion. The GM will inform players at the start of the turn, round,
        or phase in which they become available. </p><p>A party of adventurers
        can use up to three limit breaks per encounter. However, an adventurer
        who has used a limit break once in an encounter cannot do so again
        during that same encounter. </p><p>Limit breaks have triggers listed in
        their descriptions and can be used when those conditions are met, even
        if it is not the adventurer’s turn. They are not classified as
        <em>instant</em> abilities, and as such can be used even if the
        adventurer has already used an <em>instant</em> ability that turn.
        </p><p>Limit breaks whose trigger is listed as <strong>Any time</strong>
        can also be used to interrupt the resolution of another ability or a
        marker’s eﬀect. For example, say a powerful enemy targets a wounded ally
        with an ability. After the dice roll to determine the amount of damage
        its eﬀect inflicts but before the ability’s eﬀect is resolved, a white
        mage uses their limit break, <strong>Pulse of Life</strong>. This limit
        break heals the targeted ally, giving them enough HP to weather their
        enemy’s fearsome blow. </p><h2>Enhancements </h2><p>Any condition that
        has a beneficial eﬀect on a character is considered an enhancement.
        Enhancements wear oﬀ in the manner specified in their eﬀect description,
        after a period of time elapses, or at the end of a phase. </p><p>Unless
        otherwise specified, a given character cannot use the same ability or
        trait to grant multiple instances of an enhancement to a single target.
        When a new instance of an enhancement is applied by the same character,
        it overwrites the original instance. However, multiple characters can
        apply separate instances of an enhancement to a single target using the
        same ability or trait. </p><p>At times, the scenario may specify that
        one or more characters are granted an enhancement. These enhancements
        will be defined in the descriptions of the eﬀects that granted
        them.</p><h2>Enfeeblements </h2><p>Any condition that has a detrimental
        eﬀect on a character is considered an enfeeblement. Enfeeblements wear
        oﬀ in the manner specified in their eﬀect description, after a period of
        time elapses, when abilities or items are used to remove them, or at the
        end of a phase. </p><p>Unless otherwise specified, a given character
        cannot use the same ability or trait to inflict multiple instances of an
        enfeeblement to a single target. When a new instance of an enfeeblement
        is applied by the same character, it overwrites the original instance.
        However, multiple characters can apply separate instances of an
        enfeeblement to a single target using the same ability or trait.
        </p><p>At times, the scenario may specify that one or more characters
        are aﬄicted with an enfeeblement. These enfeeblements will be defined in
        the descriptions of the eﬀects that inflicted them. The list below
        includes the most common enfeeblements:</p><h4>Damage Over Time (DOT)
        </h4><ul><li><p>Damage over time eﬀects always specify the amount of
        damage they inflict using a set of parentheses, such as <strong>DOT
        (3)</strong> or <strong>DOT (User’s INT)</strong>. </p></li><li><p>An
        adventurer or ally aﬄicted with a damage over time eﬀect takes damage
        specified by the <strong>DOT</strong> at the end of each round’s
        [Adventurer Step]. </p></li><li><p>An enemy aﬄicted with a damage over
        time eﬀect takes damage specified by the <strong>DOT</strong> at the end
        of each round’s [Enemy Step]. </p></li></ul><h4>Prone </h4><ul><li><p>A
        <strong>Prone</strong> character cannot take a standard movement action
        on their turn unless they spend half their Speed (rounded up, typically
        3 squares) to get back on their feet. Standing up in this fashion
        removes the <strong>Prone</strong> enfeeblement. </p></li><li><p>A
        <strong>Prone</strong> character incurs a -2 penalty on all checks.
        </p></li><li><p>Characters receive one advantage die when making ability
        checks targeting a <strong>Prone</strong> character. </p></li><li><p>The
        <strong>Prone</strong> enfeeblement does not stack, even if it is
        inflicted multiple times. In these cases, only a single instance of the
        eﬀect remains. </p></li></ul><h4>Slow </h4><ul><li><p>A
        <strong>Slowed</strong> character has their <strong>Speed</strong>
        halved (rounded up) and cannot be aﬀected by eﬀects which would add to
        their <strong>Speed</strong>. </p></li><li><p>A <strong>Slowed</strong>
        character incurs a -2 penalty on all checks. </p></li></ul><h4>Blind
        </h4><ul><li><p>A <strong>Blinded</strong> character cannot see and
        automatically fails checks that rely entirely on vision. Ability checks
        made when using abilities that target enemies or allies incur the
        penalty listed below, as <strong>Blinded</strong> characters can still
        rely on their other senses to get a general idea of the target’s
        position. </p></li><li><p>Characters receive one advantage die when
        making ability checks targeting a <strong>Blinded</strong> character.
        </p></li><li><p>A <strong>Blinded</strong> character incurs a -2 penalty
        on all checks. </p></li></ul><h4>Stun </h4><ul><li><p>A
        <strong>Stunned</strong> character cannot act during their turn or use
        instant abilities. </p></li><li><p>Any and all markers for which a
        <strong>Stunned</strong> character is the creator are
        removed.</p></li><li><p>Characters receive one advantage die when making
        ability checks targeting a <strong>Stunned</strong> character.
        </p></li><li><p>A <strong>Stunned</strong> character incurs a -5 penalty
        on all checks. </p></li><li><p>The <strong>Stunned</strong> enfeeblement
        can only be removed via the means detailed in the description of the
        eﬀect that inflicted it. It cannot be removed by eﬀects that remove
        enfeeblements. </p></li></ul><h4>Knocked Out </h4><ul><li><p>A character
        that has been <strong>Knocked Out</strong> is unconscious and cannot
        perceive their surroundings. They cannot use abilities or perform other
        actions during their turn. </p></li><li><p>A character that has been
        <strong>Knocked Out</strong> is treated as both <strong>Prone</strong>
        and <strong>Stunned</strong>. </p></li><li><p>A character that has been
        <strong>Knocked Out</strong> cannot recover <strong>HP</strong> or
        <strong>MP</strong>. The <strong>Knocked Out</strong> enfeeblement does
        not wear oﬀ at the end of a phase, and can only be removed by eﬀects
        that specifically remove it. </p></li><li><p>A <strong>Knocked
        Out</strong> character has all enhancements and enfeeblements removed
        and can be aﬄicted with no further enfeeblements except the
        <strong>Comatose</strong>
        enfeeblement.</p></li></ul><h4>Weakness</h4><ul><li><p>A
        <strong>Weakened</strong> character incurs a -2 penalty on all checks.
        </p></li><li><p>If a character aﬄicted with Weakness is the target of
        another eﬀect that inflicts this enfeeblement, they are instead aﬄicted
        with the <strong>Brink of Death</strong> enfeeblement.
        </p></li><li><p>The <strong>Weakened</strong> enfeeblement does not wear
        oﬀ at the end of a phase, and can only be removed by completing a rest
        action (see page 14 of the Gamemaster Book) or by eﬀects that
        specifically remove it. </p></li></ul><h4>Brink of Death
        </h4><ul><li><p>A character on the <strong>Brink of Death</strong>
        incurs a -5 penalty on all checks. </p></li><li><p>If a character on the
        <strong>Brink of Death</strong> is the target of another eﬀect that
        inflicts this enfeeblement, they are instead aﬄicted with the Comatose
        enfeeblement. </p></li><li><p>The <strong>Brink of Death</strong>
        enfeeblement does not wear oﬀ at the end of a phase, and can only be
        removed by completing a rest action (see page 14 of the Gamemaster Book)
        or by eﬀects that specifically remove it. </p></li></ul><h4>Comatose
        </h4><ul><li><p>A <strong>Comatose</strong> character is treated as if
        they were <strong>Knocked Out</strong> for gameplay purposes.
        </p></li><li><p>The <strong>Comatose</strong> enfeeblement can only be
        removed by spending one sun—a full day in-game—in a location where
        appropriate medical treatment is available, as determined by the GM.
        </p></li><li><p>A <strong>Comatose</strong> character has all
        enhancements and enfeeblements removed and can receive no further
        enfeeblements except <strong>Death</strong>. </p></li></ul><h4>Death
        </h4><ul><li><p>As the name implies, a <strong>Dead</strong> character
        has died and can no longer participate in the game.
        </p></li><li><p>Unless otherwise specified, <strong>Death</strong>
        cannot be reversed or removed. </p></li></ul><p>Note that characters who
        have been <strong>Knocked Out</strong> or are <strong>Comatose</strong>
        will not <strong>Die</strong>, unless the scenario or the GM rules
        otherwise.</p>
